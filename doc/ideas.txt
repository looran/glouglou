After Json talk:

Probe
* sends packets / connections about nodes that are around
* sends informations about nodes that are around distance, path ...
* forwards informations about other probes

Processing server
* a graph out of network informations, which nodes are connected to which
* has the state of all the network

Visualisation client (small, no processing)
* transfers full graph on connection
* then graph updates, about nodes
* push / pull ?
